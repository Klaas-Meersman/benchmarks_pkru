Simple Example Microbenchmarks

A few simple microbenchmarks for you to test.

Note that some of the benchmarks do something useful, but others do not.  The
beauty of microbenchmarks is that they don't have to be meaningful, just evoke
interesting behavior in the microarchitecture.
 
# Build Instructions:

Make all the benchmarks with the following command:

```
make
```
