Simple Example Microbenchmarks

A few simple microbenchmarks for you to test.

Note that some of the benchmarks do something useful, but others do not.  The
beauty of microbenchmarks is that they don't have to be meaningful, just evoke
interesting behavior in the microarchitecture.

# Input Generation

Two of the benchmarks requires a random array (randArr.h and spmvArr.h), which are generated by invoking python programs from the makefile.  Feel free to play with the parameters of these python scripts.
 
# Build Instructions:

Make all the benchmarks with the following command:

```
make
```
